# Portfolio-Module-2

# What I Did

In this assignment, I made a portfolio about myself including an about me. my work, and contact info. My portfolio includes a picture of myself 
and my inspiraton to get into coding. I made a Index and CSS page and used both to customize my portfolio to my liking. I went for a green
aesthetic with this project because it makes the page feel peaceful. 

#Challenges

Some challenges I faced were trying to make the boxes stay put next to each other. I also had trouble inputing links on the images 
themselves, but I have definitely learned a lot.
